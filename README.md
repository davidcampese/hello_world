# hello_world
this is just a test in order to learn how to use GitHub

This is David!
I'm a musician (electronic musician and classical guitarist) fell in love with programming and UI/UX design.
The problem is that I don't have any background of coding so I find myself stuck very often also in this case; trying to understand how GitHub works. 
Moreover I'm italian so it's possible that my english will be easily wrong! Sorry guys I'm a mess!
